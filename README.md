# CryptoCurrRNN
Crypto Currency With RNN is a school project which I had to use an Deep Learning neural network algorithm on this project. While I was searching for tutorial on Deep Learning, I found sentdex youtube channel which I started watching the tutorial videos and same time working on crypto currency project.
## DATASETS
we have a dataset of 4 type of currency which are BTC-USD(BitCoin cash), LTC-USD(LightCoin), ETH-USD(Etherium) and BCH-USD(BitCoin).

we have values of all type of currencies which are time, low, high ,open ,close and volume.
Time will be our index value which we are going to join all currencies in one table.
The features which we are going to use to predict are close and volume values.
